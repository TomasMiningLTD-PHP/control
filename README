Intention/Purpose
-----------------

The cgminer API frontend allows you to control several aspects of your minerfarm, after installing the frontend on a webserver that has access to your miner network.

Supported (tested) Version
--------------------------

CGMiner 3.7.2
API 1.32

HOWTO
-----

Extract arcive into /var/www or whatever your DOCROOT is.

Database: api.db into a directory which can't be reached from docroot or rename it to .htapi.db since Apache will refuse to give .ht files to browsers.

Configure in application/config/database.php
$db['default']['hostname'] = 'sqlite:./../.htapi.db'; point to the directory where .htapi.db hides

For your webfrondend to contact the miner API, you have to have at least these settings in your cgminer.conf:

"api-listen" : true,
"api-mcast-port" : "4028",
"api-network" : true,
"api-port" : "4028",
"api-allow" : "W:0/0",
"api-description" : "<Change to unique miner description>" 

!Warning! "api-allow" : "W:0/0" allows ANY host to access your miner!

In order to have only a single IP (of your webserver that runs the frondend) accessing your miner API, just set it to that IP "W:192.168.1.1" 
You also can have a network range allowing access using: "W:192.168.1.0/24"

When you load your site and have no IP numbers set, an error might be displayed.

Click on [MANAGE] and add one or more IPs to the textfield, one IP number per line
Click send and the IP numbers should be written to the database
Now click on [Back] and the miners should be contracted and hopefully send reply back to the frondend

In the frondend you can now monitor the status of your miners. To manage your pools, expand the display by clicking on the headline. In the pools-table you now have the options to Disable, Switch, Enable or Remove pools.
Above this table, you can add new pools by entering the details and click [+ add].
(Note: you need to have writeaccess ("W:" to your miner for these actions to work)

For each pool, you see four buttons. These allow you to

- [Rem]ove
- [Sw]itch
- [En]able
- [Dis]able

your pools. Enabled pools will be switched automatically when a lower priority pool fails (goes down).

When you click [save], the frontend tells the miner to save the actual running config under default filename (.cgminer/cgminer.conf) so your setting stay on rebooting the miner.

Additional config (optional)
----------------------------

application/config/avConf.php holds additional variable fields, normally its not needed to edit them but you can:

apicmds: Commands that are send/requested to/from API
mintemp/maxtemp: Temperature interval for display; mintemp => green, maxtemp => red/warn
viewfields: for the simplified view, these fields of the command-reply are displayed, other hidden
abstractview: these fields of the command-reply are displayed in the abstract, the collapsed headline
dbFields, dbMap: for statistic database (not yet used)

Protecting your frontend
------------------------

As of now, the frondend has no login, so if you need a login, please stick with Basic-Auth (.htaccess) for now.

Further addition/TODO
---------------------

backend cron
javascript/ajax
statistics
config backup
multicast?
